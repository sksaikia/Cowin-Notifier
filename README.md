# Cowin-Notifier

This is a python script which can notify you about vaccination available slots. It uses the API provided by CoWIN and fetches available slots for vaccination. You can input your pincodes(multiple) and number of days you want to fetch and it will notify you about the slots.
Pincode, number of days and search time can be changed from the script. Next I will build a scrapper which uses state and district codes.

#Full Setup Guide
  You have to install multiple packages for it.
